- The data to reproduce Table 1 are available in [this Google Drive repository](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1quiURu7w0nU3Pxcc448xRgfeI80okLsS). Alternatively, you can download all the data sets (except MNIST and MNIST-Fashion) directly from the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php).
- `data-utils.py` contains starter code to load the 6 datasets in Table 1 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12207).
- You will need to download the files, unzip them and modify the `/home/lemisma/datasets` path in `data-utils.py` to point to your local copy.
- `run.py` contains the necessary code to reproduce the results in Table 1. This script allows you to specify the dataset and other parameters. To run the script, navigate to the directory containing `run.py` and use the following command: `python run.py`.
